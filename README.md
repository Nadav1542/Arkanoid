# Arkanoid OOP Game

## Project Overview

This project is an implementation of a classic game, [Your Game Name], using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The game requires players to control [describe main character, object, or mechanics briefly, e.g., "a paddle to bounce a ball and hit targets on the screen"]. This project primarily focuses on creating a modular and reusable codebase while adhering to OOP best practices.

## Features

- **Game Mechanics**: Includes [list core mechanics like "paddle control, ball movement, collision detection, scoring, etc."].
- **Modular Design**: The game’s architecture is structured for flexibility and reusability, allowing easy maintenance and expansion.
- **User Interface**: A graphical user interface (GUI) provides an interactive experience, enhancing engagement.
- **OOP Principles**: The project emphasizes core OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and the use of abstract classes and design patterns like Observer and Singleton.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Nadav1542/Arkanoid.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE ([suggest IDEs like IntelliJ, Eclipse]).
3. Compile and run the main class to start the game.

## Technologies Used

- **[Programming Language, e.g., Java]**: Primary language for the game’s implementation.
- **Object-Oriented Programming Principles**: Utilized to create a structured and efficient codebase.
